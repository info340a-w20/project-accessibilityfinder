# Creating equal access

<https://info340a-w20.github.io/project-accessibilityfinder/>

According to the US Census taken in 2010, 20% of the United States population is recognized as having a
disability. Some of the different categories of disabilities are physical, sensory limitations, neurological, along with others. We believe that there isnâ€™t enough awareness for the issue as whole and with that not enough emphasis into ensuring access to people with disabilities.

As we constantly strive toward creating equal opportunities in schools, the workplace, and our communities, it's crucial that we also include in this discussion the ways we are making the world more accessible to everyone. We believe that there has been great improvement in this realm, but we think a lot of information is missing in regards to the different resources currently available.
It is significant that we both work as a society to create more accessible spaces and that we do a lot better in sharing and creating awareness about these issues and how we plan to fix them.
For example, we have made a lot of positive steps toward creating schools more accessible to people with
disabilities. Large efforts have been taken since the 1990 Disability Act, especially in creating wheelchair access in buildings as well as using different more accessible technology to aid different categories of disabilities.
However, even though we have made a lot of progress, we believe that it is important that we continue to increase
our efforts in creating awareness and sharing information about the places that have put an effort into creating inclusivity.
We also believe that a larger focus needs to be made in order to create accessible access at locations of
entertainment such as theaters, stadiums, and the gaming world. Creating an inclusive environment and giving
everyone the opportunity to enjoy a sporting event, a movie, or video games is something we think should be worked on.
In order to do this, there needs to be an accessible and easy information source for how people can access these
resources.
