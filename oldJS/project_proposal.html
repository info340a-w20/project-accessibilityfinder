        <h2>Creating equal access</h2>
        <p>
        According to the US Census taken in 2010, 20% of the United States population is recognized as having a
        disability. Some of the different categories of disabilities are physical, sensory limitations, neurological, along
        with others. We believe that there isnâ€™t enough awareness for the issue as whole and with that not enough
        emphasis into ensuring access to people with disabilities.
        As we constantly strive toward creating equal opportunities in schools, the workplace, and our communities, it's
        crucial that we also include in this discussion the ways we are making the world more accessible to everyone. We
        believe that there has been great improvement in this realm, but we think a lot of information is missing in regards
        to the different resources currently available.
        It is significant that we both work as a society to create more accessible spaces and that we do a lot better in
        sharing and creating awareness about these issues and how we plan to fix them.
        For example, we have made a lot of positive steps toward creating schools more accessible to people with
        disabilities. Large efforts have been taken since the 1990 Disability Act, especially in creating wheelchair access
        in buildings as well as using different more accessible technology to aid different categories of disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, even though we have made a lot of progress, we believe that it is important that we continue to increase
        our efforts in creating awareness and sharing information about the places that have put an effort into creating
        inclusivity.
        We also believe that a larger focus needs to be made in order to create accessible access at locations of
        entertainment such as theaters, stadiums, and the gaming world. Creating an inclusive environment and giving
        everyone the opportunity to enjoy a sporting event, a movie, or video games is something we think should be worked
        on.
        In order to do this, there needs to be an accessible and easy information source for how people can access these
        resources.

        <h2>Potential Web Applications</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Accessibility Finder</li>
        <p>
        The idea of this app is to have the main interface be either a search engine or a map (like Google Maps). The
        app would then give different locations that are wheelchair accessible. This could range from different stadiums
        and how many accessible seats there are, to different theaters across the United States. This would also include
        courthouses, schools, malls, and other various public spaces. Our idea is that a lot of the information would be
        potentially crowdsourced. The users would be able to search for different locations such as theaters and then
        the different theaters that have accessibility options would show up on the map. Users would also be able to
        give input and submit information regarding locations they have been to with accessibility features in order to
        continuously update the app.
        </p>
        <li>Accessible Gaming</li>
        <p>
        The idea of this app is to aggregate information and resources regarding different efforts that have been made
        in order to make video games more accessible. For example, Minecraft has worked to make the game more accessible
        to people with autism. Progress is made both in the gaming software and hardware; for example, there is work on
        making a lot of games playable just with one hand. I think that with the progress that is being made, there is not
        enough awareness and information on all the new resources that have been created. This app would have a list of
        games released and when each game is clicked, it would provide the different accessibility options available
        for the games on different platforms. Users would mostly be browsing this website, either when they are just
        trying to find games that have accessibility features or to check if a game they want has an accessibility
        feature they need.
        </p>
        <li>Accessibility in Sports</li>
        <p>
        The idea of this app is to create a visual representation and resource guide that encompasses different ways people 
        with different disabilities can participate in the sports that they enjoy. This website would be interacted by user 
        scrolling through the lists of sports with available programs and leagues to people with different disabilities. 
        After clicking on a sport, the user would then choose the location that they would like to search for active programs 
        with as large a searching radius as they choose. User would be able to make an account in order to also suggest different
        leagues and programs they have found useful for engaging in sports. The different programs for each sport would be
        categorized by type of disability. We plan to gather this data by a combination of an API with leagues and professional
        events as well as giving users the ability to crowdsource information.
