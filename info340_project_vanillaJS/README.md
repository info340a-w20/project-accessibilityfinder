# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Development_ course at the UW iSchool. All CSS files should be written in a `css/` folder, while all JavaScript files should be created in a `js/` folder.

The included `test.spec.js` script will check for syntax and style errors in your `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files. Simply run the `jest` command to check this. We also suggest that you use the [WAVE accessibility tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to assess the accessibility of your project at each stage

Once you create a `gh-pages` branch, the site can be viewed at <https://info340a-w20.github.io/project-accessibilityfinder/>.
